# INST-Cipher

This program simulates a Caesar Cipher and allows a user to provide as many strings as they would like to either be encrypted or decrypted. Users can determine the size and direction of the shift. Users will have a choice of either simply entering inputs when prompted to, using command line arguments, or entering a file with plaintext to be encrypted or decrypted. All encrypted and decrypted text will be stored in a file called "cipher_results.txt" for future use. However, this won't occur if the user chooses to input text from a file. 

In order to use this program, users must store both sarinali_cipher_final.py and cipher_functions.py in the same directory. Otherwise, an error may occur. This program runs at the command line and accepts command line arguments (plaintext, shift direction, shift size, and whether to encrypt/decrypt the plaintext). Users should follow on-screen prompts to select their method of inputting plaintext.
